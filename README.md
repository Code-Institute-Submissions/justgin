You guessed it. 

We sell gin.

Our shop is going to get bigger, and it's going to get harder to choose. justGin is a project, developed as part of my (William Marjoribanks') fourth and final Milestone within the curriculum at Code Institute, Dublin.

It has been deployed to [Github Pages]() and [Heroku]().

## UX
### Concept

It's been a really horrid year for everyone this year. Unless of course, you've enjoyed not having to make small talk at work during your half-hour break or commuting every day in the pouring rain - justGin is based in Scotland, so it  <em>always</em> rains. <strong>Always</strong>. 
<br>

But now that society is regaining a slice of freedom by the week, and restrictions aren't as strict. It's time to celebrate - safely and responsibly. And why not with a bottle (or two) of premium artisanal gin? Well justGin, provides their users with a platform to do just that at affordable prices and some advice on pairings and flavour notes.

### Wireframes

The wireframes created with [Balsamiq]('https://balsamiq.com') at the beginning of the project and used as a reference throughout are situated in a dedicated folder entitled 
['wireframes'](https://github.com/LHBank/justgin/tree/master/wireframes), at project level. It contains screenshot images, for both the Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop viewport screen sizes, due to the use of Bootstrap 4, and the prioritisation on Mobile-first devices.
